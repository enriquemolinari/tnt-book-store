Trying to create an implementation in Java of a simple online book store application modeled using the object oriented paradigm. Usually, you will find examples full of anemic objects where the business logic is spread along the entire application. This example is not that case (at least we tried to achieve that). Objects must contain business logic, must do the job. This also includes persistence using Hibernate to add another level of complexity, as sometimes is easy to corrupt the object model with code that specifically deals with persistence.
