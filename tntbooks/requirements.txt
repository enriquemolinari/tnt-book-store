Tnt Books Store's assignment
----------------------------

Develop a REST API for a book shop. The API should be able to handle the following request:
-	Create a shopping cart
o	Input: customer Id. The customer must be a valid customer for the book store.
o	Output: the Id of the created cart.
-	Add a book to the created cart
o	Input: the id of the cart, ISBN and quantity.
o	Output: cart content
-	List cart content
o	Input: the id of the cart
o	Output: cart content
-	Checkout.
o	Input: the id of the cart, the customer id.
o	Output: the id of the transaction, or an error message describing what was wrong.
-	List purchases
o	Input: the customer id.
o	Output: List of purchases

The cart will have a 30 minutes timeout from the last time the cart was used. It will only accept books that belong to the Tnt editorial and exists on the catalog. 

The customer will pay with credit card, and the credit card is validated by a merchant processor. The book shop is charged for each call to the merchant processor, so it must be used few times for end to end testing at the end of the development. Here is the URL to call the merchant processor: https://www.merchant.com/debit, with the following parameters:
-	creditCardNumber
-	creditCardExpiration: 2 digits for the month and 4 for the year.
-	creditCardOwner: up to 30 characters.
-	transactionAmount
If the URL request/parameters do not match with the ones above, the merchant processor will return the http code 400. In any other case, it will return the http code 200 and:
•	0|OK
•	1|ERROR_DESCRIPTION if there is any error

All purchases needs to be persisted. The purchase is persisted even if the merchant processor is not available. The unpaid purchases will be charged to the customer off line.
